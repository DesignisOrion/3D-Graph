# Simple 3D Graph

### About 
This project contains a simple 3D graph

### Technologies Used:
- Python 3
- Matplotlib

### What I learned:
In this project I was able to create a simple 3D graph using matplotlib. This project allowed me to learn how to plot 3D due to working with much of 2D charts prior. All plots are made up and not from any dataframe. Enjoy!
